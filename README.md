## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

*  WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
*  WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
*  WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
*  WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
*  WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
*  WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## What I Learned
* This homework is the first assignment i have been able to solve without studying how other people have solved it. I am feeling very good about that.
* Understanding jQuery syntax. I am beginning to grasp how to utilize it to streamline my code.  
* I am starting to feel comfortable with the local storage operations.
* Traversing the dom tree like tarzan and figuring out the shortest path to the intended target.
* Understanding the basics of dayjs() and how it can be utilized. 

## Future Improvements
* I know the js code can be simplified in the if else statements
* Adding a setInterval function to dynamically update the time
* being able to save multiple items in each block. for example, the duties of staff within that hour.
